Project functional specification
This homework should be done as a group. You will write a functional specification for your project. This should include the following:

 - Background. What problem you're trying to solve. Why it's important. How your users will benefit.
 - Users. Who will use your system? What level of computer experience do they require? What domain knowledge must they have?
 - Use cases. How will users interact with the system and how will the system respond. You likely want to have "mock ups" of screen shots and indicate how users will interact.
 
 The functional specification is typically 3-5 pages.
